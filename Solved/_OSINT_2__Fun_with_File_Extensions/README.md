# [OSINT-2] Fun with File Extensions
OSINT

## Challenge 
DESCRIPTION
Now that we have their company website, it will be helpful for us to know how the company layout is like.

Note:
This challenge does not require brute-forcing. There is no need to do so.

ATTACHED FILES
None

## Solution

Info we know so far:
- Company: UnduplicitousCorp
- Website: https://www.unduplicitouscorp.tech/

From some searching around, then we get the file Organisation_Chart.pdf.

We see an image of the flag hidden behind. We have to edit the PDF. I simply used LibreOffice Draw which can edit PDFs.
