## Solution

Use https://quipqiup.com/

And we get this string. I extracted the upper case

	it is not really difficult to construct a series of inferences, eacH dependent upon its prEdecessoR and each simple in itself. if, after doing so, onE simply knocks out all the cenTral inferences and presents one's audience with the starting-point and the conclUsion, one may pRoduce a startliNg, though possibly a meretriciouS, effect.

Extract the upper case

## Flag

	CDDC20{HERETURNS}
